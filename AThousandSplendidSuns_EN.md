## Afghanistan and Women: The Unfinished Liberation

Politics is a game for politicians in power. We are like tiny ants, just small dots, living our lives, moved around by big forces, and it's hard to resist.  Afghan women experience violence at home and bullying due to deep-rooted and systematic oppression. It affects every breath they take and lurks in everyone's mind. 

> How many times must the cannon balls fly 
>
> Before they're forever banned?
>
> How many years can some people exist
>
> Before they're allowed to be free?
>
> The answer is blowing in the wind.

Liberation is not just about talking about democracy or getting help from outside. With the Taliban back, how can Afghan women find relief from their hardships? I hope Hosseini, as an Afghan writer, honestly and bravely addresses this, unless he sees himself more as an American one.

## Mariam and Lyla: Rising Above Genderism

I was so shocked that Mariam, who was always quiet, was the first to break free from her own mental chains. She bravely defeated Rasheed and then selflessly sacrificed herself for Lyla and Aziza. üò≠üò≠

Male dominance is rooted in admiring power and is supported by old, feudal traditions. Women are left outside of this system, taken apart, and then labeled with a selling price. Ironically, the very thoughts trying to destroy you don't even involve you.

So, it's easy to understand the fear many women feel: Marriage can feel like exposing your vulnerable inner in a male-dominated world. And a bad marriage means fighting and enduring constant pains alone.  For example, Nana, trapped in a mud hut; Mariam, treated like she's worthless; and even the well-educated Lyla (who's luckier than the others).

But silently enduring is also a way of hiding. In society and at work, women hit glass ceilings everywhere. For a female individual, real growth comes from within, that can challenge and even break these outer limits. It's not about willpower; it's driven by fierce and deep emotions: Why choose something even if it's harder? Why still fight?

I really wish I could join the ‚òï‚òï afternoons of Lyla and Mariam ü•∞. Even in tough times, they weave poetry into their days. Mariam is the splendid ‚òÄÔ∏è of Lyla.

To defeat the male chauvinism, it won't be by the female chauvinism. Instead, it's about going beyond gender as a metric, breaking free from the thinking of 'might makes right'. Just like there are differences in height and weight, there are also some differences between men and women, but, SO WHAT?

## Lyla and Tariq: An Ideal Love Story

Liking someone is possessive, but loving is about respect.

Keeping a relationship is not easy. The thought that an ideal partner will make things easier can actually complicate finding peace in the relationship. Because love has its own journey of growth and is not a box holding all expectations. Equality is vital here: both sides appreciate each other as unique, vibrant, and independent individuals. 

And approaching all relationships with equality and genuine heart, some turning romantic, others becoming friendships, but all serving as inspirations in our lives ü•∞.

Love stems from solitude. Two individuals who harmonize but are not exactly the same, engage in simple communication, and then they appreciate each other. They experience a bright and simple joy in each other's company, and accumulate inner strength. Although the goal is the shared happiness and peace,  they are, in fact, independently striving, but aiding in each other's self-discovery ü•∞. We are all crafting our lives like an unique piece of art.

A relationship is like a journey, not just a result. In it, we experience our hearts opening and stretching, feeling various emotions and sharing them, while also sensing the other person's honesty and growth. Boldly and freely explore ourselves, without losing patience and curiosity about who we are. Each day spent together is a non-copyable sharing. The process itself is our achievement ü•∞, regardless of the end outcome.

Yet, loneliness is inevitable and necessary. Love cannot entirely erase it. Many subconscious matters can only be expressed to ourselves in a language unique to us, digested and renewed in solitude. The care of others is not something taken for granted; every bit of help is a gift, and moving us. Because the relationship is an extra blessing ü•∞, while originally, we have to navigate our own lives alone.

We're all travelers in life, and glad to be companions, walking a part of the journey together. üòä
