# Across the Furious Sea: Seeking the Real Love 

A story about a father revenging for his daughter, about trauma from the original family. But who is the murderer, the boyfriend, rapists, the daughter herself, ..., or the father?

"**Can you feel my love? I give you all my love, but what the real love is?**"

Parents' self-moving love, build no link between each other, and no communication. So receivers can never accept it as love. Therefore, the young only feel their own presence when in intense pains, or in neurotic romantic relationships.

The double-meaning of the title `Across the Furious Sea`:
- For parents, it means, get rid of the self-touching of parent-role-playing, **see** the loved children for who they are, and truly care for them.
- For children, it means, do not be speechless in the lack of love, hug ourselves first, and continue to seek what is love.

> Hints in Japanese:
> - `suki` is a one-way love.
> - `ai` is a two-way love.
